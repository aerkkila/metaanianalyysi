Start by downloading the data from ftp://litdb.fmi.fi/outgoing/SMOS-FTService/
This can be done using the code lataa.sh (download).
Using that code, it is safe to stop the download and re-running the code will then continue the download and not start over.
That code also avoids saving any incomplete file which would cause problems later.
Downloaded size will be around 38 Gb consisting of approximately 4000 files.

The data can be then created by compiling and running yhdist√§_vuosittain.c (combine annually).
That combines daily files into yearly files and if a file is missing, the values are copied from the previous day.
