Data must be first downloaded and preprocessed, see create_data.

Thereafter start by compiling and running maski.c.
That will create maski.nc which contains all grid cells where SMOS F/T data is defined in some day.
Many grid cells are defined only part of time but all those will be used which are defined in some day.

Then compile and run ftpercent.c:
~$ gcc ftpercent.c -Ofast -lnctietue3 -lproj
~$ ./a.out
